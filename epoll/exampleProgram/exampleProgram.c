 Description : Uses shared library to print greeting
               To run the resulting executable the LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be
               set to ${project_loc}/libepoll/.libs
               Alternatively, libtool creates a wrapper shell script in the
               build directory of this program which can be used to run it.
               Here the script will be called exampleProgram.
